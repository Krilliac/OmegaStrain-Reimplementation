# Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain reimplementation research

This workspace is the clean-room research starting point for a native reimplementation of
*Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain* (NTSC-U, `SCUS-97264`). PCSX2 is used as a behavioral
oracle and debugger; it is not intended to be a dependency of the eventual native runtime.

## Current verified baseline

- Official PCSX2 `master` built from commit `86d76bbf590566d9ea74d381eeff3acd9856503a`.
- Build output: `third_party/pcsx2/bin/pcsx2-qtx64-avx2.exe` (PCSX2 2.7.485).
- Official Windows dependency archive SHA-256:
  `9C02B2CF15DA632B7D862131486B6CD8D7C58979D5F8C345F0BA4E0E2AEC3FD1`.
- Owned NTSC-U disc image SHA-256:
  `A60A4B41FEA808335BAA3B887A377BB98063F6F169CA498EFEE49397FBA96130`.
- Boot verified with USA BIOS v1.60, serial `SCUS-97264`, CRC `D5605611`,
  ELF entry point `0x00100008`, and D3D12 rendering.
- The disc is extracted under the ignored `private/extracted-disc/` tree.
- All 273 top-level HOG archives validate against the documented directory layout: 32,351
  contained entries and zero structural errors.

## Quick start

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File .\scripts\launch-omega.ps1
```

Open the PCSX2 debugger and break at the game entry point:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File .\scripts\launch-omega.ps1 -Debugger
```

Load the recovered resume state:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File .\scripts\launch-omega.ps1 -Resume
```

Print the exact command without launching another emulator instance:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File .\scripts\launch-omega.ps1 -Debugger -DryRun
```

The prior handoff proposed `-x -lMINSK` as game arguments. It is still an unverified
hypothesis, but the launcher can now test it explicitly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File .\scripts\launch-omega.ps1 -Debugger -GameArgs '-x -lMINSK'
```

## Layout

- `docs/` — handoff and research notes.
- `tools/` — deterministic disc/ELF archaeology tools.
- `analysis/` — generated, redistributable metadata and reports.
- `analysis/formats/HOG.md` — validated HOG container layout and extraction notes.
- `analysis/elf/loader-hints.md` — confirmed executable evidence and open loader questions.
- `third_party/pcsx2/` — ignored official PCSX2 checkout and build.
- `runtime/` — ignored isolated PCSX2 data/configuration and logs.
- `private/` — ignored owned BIOS, disc image, extracted assets, and save states.

## Legal boundary

The repository must never contain Sony firmware, a game ISO, extracted proprietary assets,
save states, or keys. Contributors provide their own legally dumped PS2 BIOS and retail disc.
Only original source code, tools, documentation, hashes, metadata, and independently created
compatibility data belong in version control.
