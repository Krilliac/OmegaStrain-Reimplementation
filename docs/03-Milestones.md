# End-to-end milestones

Each milestone ends with an executable regression, not only a research note.

## M0: Reproducible laboratory

- Current PCSX2 source build, isolated BIOS/disc data root, known game hash, boot log.
- Proprietary-data ignore gate and clean-room method.
- Evidence ledger, native CMake build, unit-test executable, and corpus-safe tooling.
- Accepted pure-native ADR: no MIPS interpretation, recompilation, or translated retail code.

## M1: Content mount and inspection

- Native HOG parser validated against all 273 archives.
- Virtual filesystem with physical-directory and HOG mounts.
- Inspectors for ELF, scripts, textures, meshes, skeletons, animation, audio, and maps.
- Synthetic malformed-input tests for every decoder.

## M2: Native shell

- Window, input, logging, configuration, jobs, renderer, audio device, and frame scheduler.
- Load the retail data tree supplied by the owner; clear diagnostics for missing/wrong region.
- Render a debug scene with no proprietary data embedded in the executable.

## M3: First level scene

- Decode and render MINSK geometry, textures, materials, cameras, and static objects.
- Match coordinate system, transforms, visibility, and representative frames against PCSX2.
- Load level through a native command-line option independent of the retail argument parser.

## M4: Actors and controls

- Skeletons, animation, player movement, camera, collision, weapons, and basic AI.
- Deterministic capture/replay for input and simulation state.

## M5: First mission loop

- Independently rewritten native mission behavior required by MINSK.
- Objectives, triggers, combat, inventory, checkpoints, failure, and completion.
- Golden scenario comparisons at named checkpoints.

## M6: Campaign coverage

- All offline levels and mission variants load and complete.
- Front end, character/gear progression, saves, difficulty, cinematics, subtitles, and audio.
- Compatibility database for known retail-data variants.

## M7: Multiplayer compatibility

- Document the original PS Rewired/DNAS-facing behavior from legal captures.
- Provide a local/community replacement protocol where lawful and technically feasible.
- Keep service credentials and packet captures containing personal data out of the repository.

## M8: Ship-quality runtime

- Performance budgets, crash recovery, accessibility, controller remapping, packaging,
  license notices, CI matrix, clean-machine install, and full regression suite.
- No firmware, disc content, executable code, or extracted asset ships with the runtime.
